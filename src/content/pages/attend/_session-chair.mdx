# Session Chairs

Want to help PyCon AU happen and introduce some of our speakers? Sign up to be a session chair!

## What’s involved in being a session chair?

Being a session chair is a great way to get involved in the conference. It involves:

- Introducing three delightful speakers in a series of talks in a room
- Holding up time cards to let the speakers know they have 5, 2, 1 minute remaining
- Helping facilitate Q&A, if the speaker wants questions after their talk

There will be a full session chair briefing at the beginning of morning tea on Saturday morning where we’ll share full details on how to be a session chair.

## How do I sign up?

We have an open spreadsheet where you can put your name down to be a session chair. Simply add your name and come to the session chair briefing at the beginning of morning tea on Saturday morning.

Visit the [session chair schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TO_CMvIf6iY_gMF8pFUzzCjt67lpBsd4leGeVCGNbjc/edit?usp=sharing) and sign up now!

Thank you for helping make PyCon AU happen!
