# Become a Contributor ✨

The Contributor ✨ sponsor package is designed for individuals, start-ups or small businesses who want to make a contribution to the running of the conference in excess of the standard conference registration rates. By having your business pay that little bit extra, you help keep the conference affordable for others who are paying out of their own pocket. Keeping the conference financially accessible = greater diversity in who can attend = a broader set of ideas and viewpoints to engage with.

Here's what you get!

- One complimentary professional-level ticket. Includes entry to the main conference weekend, specialist day on Friday and the sprints on Monday and Tuesday.
- Logo displayed at Plenary Sessions. As a sponsor your logo will be presented at the conference plenary sessions.
- Website Exposure. Your logo will be linked on our sponsors page.

To become a Contributor sponsor is easy - simply select the "Contributor" ticket [when you register](https://2025.pycon.org.au/attend/)!
