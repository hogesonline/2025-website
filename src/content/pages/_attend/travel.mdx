# Travelling to PyCon AU 2024

For some folks, PyCon AU 2024 will be their first time in Melbourne. Welcome! For others, it might have been a few years so welcome back! Here are some advice for getting around town (and to the conference).

## Interstate & International travel

Book travel to Melbourne Tullamarine Airport (MEL). Melbourne also has a second airport, Avalon Airport (AVV), which is significantly further from the city and less well-served by public transport.

Both MEL and AVV are served by [SkyBus](https://www.skybus.com.au/), a shuttle bus service that runs regularly between airports and the city. Tickets can be purchased upon arrival but are cheaper ($40 return for an adult) if pre-booked online.

## Public transport

All Melbourne public transport uses [Myki](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/tickets/Myki) smartcards for ticketing (similar to the Opal, Go Card, SmartRider, and MetroCard systems in other cities). Myki is the only way to pay for public transport in Melbourne; you can't buy paper tickets on board or at stations.

You can purchase a Myki card at the airport, most train stations, and many convenience stores around town. The card costs $6 and needs to be topped up with money for travel.

### Trams

Melbourne has an extensive and easy to use tram network. Travel is free inside [the Free Tram Zone](https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PDFs/Maps/Network-maps/5b4a3efe80/PTV-Free-Tram-Zone-Map.pdf) covering most of the CBD, but you need to 'tap on' with your Myki if travelling outside the green zone.

### Trains

Train fares in Melbourne also use the Myki system. The closest train station to the conference venue is Southern Cross Station, which connects to most suburban lines, all regional lines, and trains to Sydney and Adelaide. (Note that while some regional lines use Myki, some regional destinations and both interstate trains have separate booking systems.)

# Arriving at PyCon AU 2024

This year's conference is held in the Goldfields Theatre at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC). MCEC is located at 1 Convention Centre Place, South Wharf, Victoria, 3006.

MCEC is a large venue with multiple entrances. The Goldfields Theatre is located on the ground floor, accessible from the main entrance on Convention Centre Place. The venue is fully accessible, with ramps and elevators available for those who need them.


## via Tram

If arriving on routes **35, 70, or 75**, alight at South Wharf/<wbr />Wurundjeri Way. From there, the venue is a 10 minute walk across Seafarers Bridge.

If arriving on routes **12, 96, or 109**, alight at Stop 124A Casino/<wbr />MCEC/<wbr />Clarendon St (Southbank) and walk via MCEC Exhibition halls to the far end. **This stop is outside the Free Tram Zone**, so you'll either need to touch on your Myki, or alight at the previous stop (Stop 124 Batman Park) and take a short stroll across the bridge.

## via Train

If arriving by train, alight at Southern Cross Station and walk across the Yarra River via the Seafarers Bridge. Alternatively, change to tram routes 12, 96 or 109; see above for details.

## via Car or Ride share

Instead of using the conference venue address, use google maps to route your drop off to the Pan Pacific Melbourne (hotel), The LUME Melbourne, or DFO. The Goldfields foyer has an entrance onto the same drop off / turning circle and it is well suited for pickup/drop-off.

If you use MCEC's address via Google Maps, you'll be able to enjoy the scenic river-side walk past the exhibition halls (alongside delegates ariving by tram).
