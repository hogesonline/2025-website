# Food at PyCon AU

Food will be available to purchase at the venue, as well as nearby.

## On-site options

Food will be available to purchase in the main foyer of the PyCon AU space. You can [browse the draft menu of what will be available here](/files/public-catering-menu.pdf).

On this menu, **GF** means gluten free, **NF** means nut free, **V** means vegetarian, and **PB** means "plant based" (aka vegan). We've asked the venue whether the vegetarian burger option is also vegan, and will update this page when we know.

[Home Ground](https://homegrounddining.com.au/menu/) is also very close by&mdash;in fact it's directly underneath the main foyer we'll be using!

The on-site food stall will be open from **8am to 4pm**. Home Ground is open from **8am to 3pm**.

## Off-site options

There's plenty of other dining options along North Terrace, Hindley Street, and a short walk away on King William Street and Rundle Mall.
