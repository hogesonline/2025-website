# Getting to and around PyCon AU

## When to get there

Registration will open at **8am** each day of the conference. You'll need to collect your badge from the registration desk before you'll be able to attend talks, so make sure you're there bright and early on your first day of the conference!

If you purchased a ticket valid for all three days (e.g. a Professional or Contributor ticket, or an Enthusiast or Student ticket with the optional Specialist Tracks add-on), the badge you collect on the Friday will be valid for all three days; you don't need to register again on the Saturday.

Talks start at 9am on each day, and end between 5pm and 5:30pm depending on the day. [See the program](/program/) for exact details.

If you're **attending PyCon AU for the first time**, it's worth trying to get to the **First Timers' Session**, at 8:25am on the Saturday. Try to get to the venue as close to 8am as you can, so that you can register and attend that session!

PyCon AU is being held in the **East Wing of the Adelaide Convention Centre**. Enter via the **Main Entrance**, which is located on North Terrace between the Riverside office building and the main convention centre building.
