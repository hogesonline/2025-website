# Conference Art

In 2024 our conference art was made by Melbourne artist Reimena Yee and features our beloved Curlyboi with Melbourne icons:

- Flinders Street Station,
- Luna Park,
- An E-class tram,
- And of course: our proud tradition of spraying art on anything that will sit still long enough to be painted.
