  applications using Python and Raspberry Pi. Attendees will have the opportunity
  to learn about Raspberry Pi, Apache Kafka + Kafka Connect, and solar power generation.</p>
description: "<p>This isn't your grandfather's electronics shop - anyone can collect
  real-time data with Python! This talk aims to demystify the complex world of data
  and hardware, with real-world applications for the Western Australian electricity
  grid.</p>\n<p>With the number of IoT devices expected to reach 29 billion by 2030,
  the significance of real-time data collection continues to grow. In this session,
  we will construct a basic microscale/hobby scale data collection system designed
  to serve as the backbone for an IoT application. Specifically, we will create a
  system to continuously collect voltage readings from a mini solar panel and record
  the data for future analysis. The system we develop can be easily adapted for different
  IoT applications.</p>\n<p>This talk is designed to be conceptual, requiring only
  a basic understanding of Python and JSON. Whether youâ€™re a beginner, hobbyist, or
  professional, join us to explore the exciting world of data and IoT!</p>"
