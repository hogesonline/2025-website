abstract: <p>There are around 6,200 primary schools around Australia, and the curriculum
  has a requirement to teach Digital Technologies, which includes a coding portion.  There
  are many challenges here, not least which is enabling the approximately 150,000
  primary school teachers with the skills and resources to teach programming to young
  students.  The AustSTEM foundation was set up to assist in this area, and developed
  a MicroPython based learning platform, which consists of a pocket-sized computing
  device that integrates with a web-based coding and teaching environment.  The teaching
  material has many hands-on activities, with connections to nature and science.  In
  this talk we will discuss this teaching platform, how it can help students transition
  from block-based programming to textual coding, and show some of the successes we
  have had so far in Australian classrooms.</p>
description: "<p>The non-for-profit AustSTEM foundation provides access and assistance
  to STEM learning\nacross Australian schools with emphasis on year 5 through to year
  7.  AustSTEM has developed\nthe Kookaberry learning platform which includes a small
  microcontroller-based board with\na screen, buttons, wireless connectivity, and
  facility to connect many different\nkinds of sensors.  A web-based coding and teaching
  environment integrates with the\nKookaberry hardware and allows programming in both
  the visual Blockly language and Python,\nwith very easy transition between the two. 
  Teachers also have the option to use a Raspberry\nPi Pico with add-on hardware within
  this learning platform, making the platform more\naccessible and flexible.</p>\n
  <p>Most programming in primary school is based on visual block-based languages like
  Scratch.\nThe Kookaberry leverages Blockly to provide a way for students to program
  physical\nhardware (a microcontroller running MicroPython) and interact with the
  environment through\nsensors such as accelerometers, pressure and moisture sensors
  and light sensors, and interact using\nLEDs and motors.  They also learn about data
  logging and visualising results of experiments\nusing plots.  This gives students
  a very hands-on approach to learning to program, which\nhelps to cement the learning
  objectives in the curriculum in real-world applications.</p>\n<p>Following on from
  learning to program in Blockly, the Kookaberry platform allows easy\ntransition
  to program in Python: the Blocks actually convert directly to Python snippets\n
  and so the students can gradually adapt their existing visual programming skills
  to\ntextual coding in Python.</p>\n<p>A big part of teaching students is first of
  all training teachers, and we will discuss\nsome challenges in this area, and how
  Kookaberry gives the teachers are given a wide range\nof teaching tools so they
  can adapt the platform to their style.  We will show some lesson\nplans, which aim
  to attract and engage students of all ages and abilities.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, the
  Kookaberry web-app is itself written in Python, and we will describe some\ntechnical
  details of how it all works.</p>\n<p>There will be lots of pictures of kids in action!</p>"
