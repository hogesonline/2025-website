abstract: "<p>Bioinformatics is the science of understanding and analysing biological
  information, such as the genetic information contained in DNA. It combines the disciplines
  of biology, computer science, and mathematics. If this seems daunting, don’t panic,
  because this talk will focus on two open-source Python packages I have developed,
  FASTQE and Biomojify, that make common bioinformatics file formats intuitive and
  accessible…. by using emoji.</p>\n<p>FASTQE simplifies DNA sequencing data analysis
  by taking numerical quality scores for the data, and summarising them using emoji
  to quickly convey the good, the bad, and the ugly of sequence data quality. Whether
  for training, outreach, or debugging, this tool can easily turn unremarkable data
  quality analysis into an appealing visualisation.</p>\n<p>Biomojify takes the concept
  further by converting plain text data to use emoji. In DNA, for example, the conventional
  format represents  individual A, C, G, and T nucleotides as plain text. Biomojify
  substitutes them with emojis such as avocado, cheese, grape, and tomato. It supports
  various bioinformatics file formats and supports user defined emoji mapping. It
  can be used to teach the underlying biological concepts behind bioinformatics data,
  by simplifying specialised data structures for a general audience. </p>\n<p>Science
  communication is hard. These tools transform complex bioinformatics data into engaging,
  emoji-based visualisations, making bioinformatics concepts more accessible and adding
  an element of fun to scientific education and communication.</p>"
description: "<p>This presentation will delve into the history and recent exciting
  developments of FASTQE and Biomojify. I will provide some background information
  on bioinformatics, and outline new developments such as support for new sequencing
  technologies and expanded emoji customization options. I will also present examples
  of teaching resources developed using these tools.</p>\n<p>As a bioinformatician
  with over a decade of experience and the main developer of these tools, I would
  love to share my roadmap and encourage more contributors to join these projects.
  I’m eager to share my love of bioinformatics with the Python community.</p>"
