abstract: "<p>Astronomers have been dealing with digital data since the 1980s and
  online databases \nsince the early 90's, and now, almost all research astronomers
  use Python to access and \nprocess that data. Most astronomical database are open
  to the public, and most research\nsoftware tools are either open source, or freely
  available.  I'll give an intro, aimed at \nnon-astronomers, to some Python packages
  (astropy, skyfield) and online research tools.</p>\n<p>This talk will give an overview
  on what tools and databases are available and how to access \nthem. Maybe you're
  writing a game, and you want the 3D locations and properties of the \nnearest 10,000
  stars (or extrasolar planets, or galaxies). Maybe you're building a Solar\npanel
  that tracks the Sun, or a camera mount that tracks the International Space\nStation.
  Maybe you're trying to model shadow lengths and directions in satellite images.
  Or\nmaybe you just want to play around with real telescope images that haven't had
  a PR \ndepartment make them 'prettier'...</p>"
