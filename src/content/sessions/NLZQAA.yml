abstract: <p>Some cheap and definitely not employer approved ways to run Django on
  AWS infrastructure on a budget</p>
description: <p>With the power of AWS and the Cloud Development Framework (CDK) we
  can spin up cheap infrastructure to host Django on. By leveraging cheap and free
  tier AWS services while also creating some very questionable resources and code
  we can scale a Django application down to a user base of 2 or less!</p>
