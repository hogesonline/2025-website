abstract: "<p>Learning to program can be exceptionally challenging for students. So
  how can we make learning to program easier for our students? </p>\n<p>This talk
  will explore concepts from the literature such as the constructivist theory of education,
  Bloomâ€™s taxonomy and the worked example effect and discuss how they can be applied
  to different teaching strategies to help students learn more effectively. Drawing
  on my own teaching experiences, I will provide some examples of how these concepts
  can inform teaching practices and guide the development of resources for teaching
  programming.</p>\n<p>The goal of this talk is to encourage other educators to reflect
  on their own teaching strategies and to consider new approaches that they could
  implement in their classrooms, whether it be through minor tweaks or a complete
  redevelopment of their teaching materials.</p>"
