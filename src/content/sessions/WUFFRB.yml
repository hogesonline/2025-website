abstract: <p>Is it possible to protect data directly and not just the systems in which
  it is stored?</p>
description: "<p>As a security-conscious Pythonista, you know to use parameterised
  database queries, validate user input, use HTTPS, turn on logging, firewalls, sprinkle
  some static analysis on the build pipeline, and do periodic penetration testing.
  </p>\n<p>But beyond that, there’s not much else you can do, right? Could there even
  be a better way to secure sensitive data without all the pain?</p>\n<p>Encryption-as-access
  control offers a compelling alternative to data security that is not only more effective
  but easier to implement reliably than traditional controls.\nMost application security
  programs are built on the assumption that we can’t protect the data directly, but
  we can build layers of defences around it to slow adversaries down.</p>\n<p>Searchable,
  encryption-in-use on the other hand,  protects data directly while retaining virtually
  all query functionality.. Recent advancements finally make it fast and flexible
  enough for use in everyday systems sans yak shaving..</p>\n<p>In this talk, attendees
  will learn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why many of the traditional approaches to encryption
  no longer make sense in 2024</li>\n<li>What modern encryption techniques exist for
  protecting data in your Python applications while keeping it searchable</li>\n<li>What
  tools you can use today in Python to apply these techniques</li>\n<li>What the performance,
  security, and usability tradeoffs are for these approaches</li>\n<li>How (not) to
  shave a yak</li>\n</ul>"
