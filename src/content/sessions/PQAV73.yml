abstract: <p>In this workshop, we will build a ChatBot based on Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG). The ChatBot will leverage MongoDB Atlas, embedding models, Large
  Language Models (LLMs) to generate contextualized answers and textual content in
  accordance to usersâ€™ queries based on publicly available sources.</p>
description: "<p>In this hands-on workshop, attendees will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn the
  foundations of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), such as chunking, embedding,
  and semantic search</li>\n<li>Perform semantic search queries against a MongoDB
  Atlas collection </li>\n<li>Build a simple RAG system using MongoDB Atlas and open-source
  LLMs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Add memory to the RAG application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In addition
  to these goals, the lab also offers more advanced content that covers:</li>\n<li>Combining
  pre-filtering with vector search</li>\n<li>Adding re-ranking to the RAG application</li>\n
  <li>Stream responses from the RAG application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attendees will be
  provided with all the resources required to successfully execute the hands-on portions
  of the workshop, including a GitHub repository consisting of notebook templates
  with pseudocode. Attendees will replace the pseudocode with their own code during
  the workshop.</p>"
