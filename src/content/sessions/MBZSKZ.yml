abstract: "<p>A modern mobile phone isn't just a powerful CPU and display. It's a
  collection of incredibly sophisticated portable sensors: multiple cameras, a high
  resolution GPS, accelerometers and more. In this talk, you'll learn how to build
  and run an app on your phone that can access these sensors, using nothing but Python.</p>"
description: <p>The BeeWare project provides the tools to build a native, cross-platform
  app for Android and iOS, using nothing but Python. In this talk, you'll learn how
  to use the tools provided by BeeWare, including Briefcase to bootstrap and deploy
  an app; and Toga to build GUI and access platform-native APIs. You'll learn about
  how to manage the device permissions required to access hardware; and you'll get
  a brief introduction to how you can access APIs for which Toga doesn't provide a
  cross platform API.</p>
