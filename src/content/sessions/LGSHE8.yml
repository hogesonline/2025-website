abstract: <p>So you’ve decided you want to use MongoDB!</p>
description: "<p>For a brand new app, your data model will grow and evolve with your
  app, but what if you already have data in another database that you want to transition
  away from?</p>\n<p>An application that was built on a relational database will have
  been built with the patterns and constraints of a relational model and SQL queries.
  The MongoDB document model is a different way of thinking about data modeling, with
  a different set of advantages and limitations. Adapting an application’s data model
  to work well with MongoDB is a fun challenge! It needs to be done with an understanding
  of the data’s context and usage patterns.</p>\n<p>This talk isn’t about whether
  or not you should switch to MongoDB, instead we’ll focus on the practicalities of
  the migration process and the challenges of transforming data from a relational
  world to a MongoDB document-model. As part of this we’ll see the tools we’ve built
  to give developers insight into their current database and provide flexibility and
  control over the migration process.</p>"
