abstract: <p>Django is an all-parts-included framework that is one of the most popular
  ways of building a website in Python.  But for many websites that's not enough -
  we also need a REST-based API with an OpenAPI specification so that other programs
  can read and work with our data.  This talk will cover the Python packages that
  can provide these facilities and how to integrate them into your existing website.</p>
description: "<p>This talk will primarily cover two packages:\n- django-rest-framework,
  or 'DRF' for short, for providing a REST API\n- drf-spectacular, for providing an
  OpenAPI schema for that API\nIt will include real world examples for how these things
  work and attendees can also try out the REST interface and OpenAPI schema the talk
  is based on.</p>"
