abstract: <p>Come and hear how we wrote 3 Django apps in a trenchcoat to run a ~300+
  person Scout camp, from making event registration a breeze, to conducting everyone's
  movements throughout the entire event.</p>
description: '<p>In the last weekend of April this year, we ran Star Trek: Survival
  (https://startreksurvival.tech), a STEM-focussed, Star Trek-themed scout camp for
  all ages, 5 to 26 years. This talk will be about the software we wrote, including
  a registration system, the Star Trek Survival main website, and a system called
  RadioActiv8, which is used to keep track of where everyone is across the campsite,
  and send them to activities when there is capacity to do so. All of this was combined
  into a single project for maximum integration and ease of use.</p>'
