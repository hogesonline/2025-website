abstract: "<p><a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">In 2020, xkcd published <em>Dependency</em></a>,
  which posited that \"all modern digital infrastructure\" is ultimately transitively
  dependent on \"a project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining
  since 2003\".</p>\n<p>How can we find these projects and ensure that their maintainers
  get the thanks and — more importantly — the resources they need?</p>"
description: "<p>(Almost) every Python project depends on packages, which depend on
  packages, which depend on packages, How do we find the ones that might need our
  help?</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert: there's no perfect quantification. (At least to my
  knowledge.)</p>\n<p>But given that, how can we use tooling designed for supply chain
  security — SBOMs, scorecards, code forge metrics — and use those to identify the
  packages that we depend upon that may be at risk, that are load bearing for our
  projects, and that we might be able to help in ways that are more targeted than
  just throwing money at the problem?</p>\n<p>(Although, also, throwing money at problems
  can be useful. Just saying.)</p>\n<p>There's lots of talk of making supply chains
  more secure. Let's make sure we also make them more sustainable as well.</p>"
