abstract: "<p>Being a fast-paced startup and developing a completely new product in
  the Space Industry is very challenging, and moving fast wasn’t just a requirement
  but essential. It's the kind of environment that is hard to think too much ahead,
  and for that reason, our database was created to address the problems we had at
  hand. \nAfter a while, new products and features were required, and our database
  couldn't handle all of them. That’s when we decided to move our data to a newly
  designed database instance with proper relationships, able to handle more features,
  higher workloads and scalable. During the planning phase, several approaches were
  discussed, such as creating a script to copy the data and some off-the-shelf software
  that we thought could handle that for us. However, the complexity of implementing
  those approaches wasn’t feasible with our deadlines for releasing the new product.
  So, we decided to copy the data using Django ORM (our product was already using
  Django), the idea was to avoid the complexity of creating complex SQL Queries to
  copy data to new tables while keeping the data consistency and integrity.\nIn this
  presentation, we aim to demonstrate how our database was limiting the company’s
  scalability and how we fixed those problems by migrating to a new database schema
  whilst maintaining two database instances, one for internal operations and the other
  for customer-facing functions. Moreover, we show how we did that using object-oriented
  programming in combination with Django’s ORM to migrate our database without the
  need to handle complex SQL commands to copy data, keep relationships, and create
  new ones.</p>"
description: <p>The presentation has three main goals; (1) show how the database that
  we had before was limiting the development of new products and, in the medium-term,
  would be a potential issue to scale; (2) present some of the options we considered
  and the tradeoffs; (3) the strategy we chose and how we implemented it (main challenges
  and how the combination of OOP and Django’s ORM actually speed up not only the process
  but made it easier).</p>
