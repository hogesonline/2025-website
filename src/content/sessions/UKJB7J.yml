abstract: <p>Tests are good. Code that uses a database is good. Testing code that
  uses a database is great… But it's not so easy to do well. Let's follow our journey
  through various pitfalls to make testing against a local PostgreSQL instance informative,
  reliable and fast, so that we have fewer horrible surprises once code gets to production.</p>
description: "<p>We follow the usual approach for building an application: store data
  in a database. Our method is SQLAlchemy models in our Python code, and migrations
  to evolve the schema. </p>\n<p>We also have the usual desire for these applications:
  they should work, and <em>continue</em> to work as we make changes. One key method
  is automated tests.</p>\n<p>Managing both of these at once is surprisingly subtle,
  but it's also good to solve: no-one likes having behaviour in production be a surprise
  because a test made incorrect assumptions about how the database behaves.</p>\n
  <p>I’ll walk us along our database testing trail, stopping in at attractions like
  (not) using SQLite, ensuring migrations and models match, efficiently instantiating
  databases with the right schemas, isolated and parallel execution, and even optimising
  how each individual tests runs.</p>"
