abstract: "<p>Imagine agreeing to develop a full stack web app to host a coding competition
  for thousands of students. Then standing at a podium in front of a large crowd as
  your app crashes and you discover that you might be in too deep.</p>\n<p>That was
  my first year of a four year journey of learning to program \"properly\" and build
  something robust and useful. The full story includes more spectacular fails, hacking
  and an eventually an app students loved using to program algorithms that do battle
  in contests based on game theory. The app is built on React / FastAPI and SQLmodel
  ORM</p>"
description: "<p>Talk sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to myself and the Victorian
  Coding Challenge (5 min)</li>\n<li>Journey through 4 platform iterations from Replit
  and Google sites to AWS / React and FastAPI (10 min)</li>\n<li>Stories about hacks,
  crashes and making a contest that is at least somewhat immune to chatGPT plagiarism.
  (10 min)</li>\n<li>Lessons learned and advice on getting things right with testing
  and data validation. (5 min)</li>\n</ol>"
