abstract: "<p>Dataframes are an abstraction that proven extremely useful for data
  analysis in dynamic languages like S, R, Python, and Julia. The Pandas package has
  been dominant in Python for around 15 years but its design is now showing its age.
  There is now a vibrant and messy ecosystem of potential disruptors to the status
  quo for data analysis tasks in Python.</p>\n<p>This talk will help you make sense
  of the mess. It will give you a comprehensive review of the strengths and weaknesses
  of the challengers, including Polars, Ibis, Modin, Dask, and the PySpark Pandas
  API (formerly known as Koalas). It will also review efforts to unify the PyData
  landscape such as Apache Arrow, the dataframe interchange protocol, Narwhals, and
  the Ibis project started by Wes McKinney, the original author of Pandas.</p>"
description: <p>The talk will provide context and guidance for deciding which dataframe
  library to choose for your next project. It will also explain the best ways to offer
  cross-dataframe support in your library code.</p>
