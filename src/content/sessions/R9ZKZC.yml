abstract: "<p>Often I hear people lamenting that Python has too many features and
  that older versions of Python were better for that exact reason.</p>\n<p>To make
  those people happy, we're going to pick apart the features of Python that enable
  the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax, layer by layer, until we happen
  upon a working implementation of coroutines that will function in Python 2.1.</p>\n
  <p>Somewhere in this talk will be some useful discussions about why recent syntactic
  developments in Python are a good thing actually, but let's not lie, you're reading
  this abstract for the stunt content. You'll get what you came for.</p>"
