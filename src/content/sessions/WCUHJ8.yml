abstract: <p>Abstractions are one of the greatest tools in all of programming. But
  sometimes we reach for them too often. How do we know when we should use an abstraction,
  and when we should just use the ones that already exist.</p>
description: "<p>Abstractions are rife in programming. You might even say they are
  the way we build meaning into our systems. But often when faced with a problem,
  we reach for a new container to neatly package it up and make it a solution. Sometimes
  this works, but most of the time, the problem either immediately leaks out, or over
  time seeps out into nearby containers, contaminating them along the way.</p>\n<p>This
  talk is about describing different types of abstraction (helpful and not-so-helpful),
  what they look like, and how to design a helpful one. In the end you will have a
  few new ways to think about when and how to create abstractions and possibly a mental
  guide to building (or not building) your own.</p>"
