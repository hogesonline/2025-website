abstract: "<p>What even is '06462f89-b4ef-7f7d-8000-edda1bba5155' and why should you
  actually care?</p>\n<p>(you should, but \"why\"?)</p>"
description: "<p>UUIDs are used all over the place, but there are a ton of variants.
  They're theoretically absolutely unique, and yet dozens of companies and projects
  abandoned the standard to invent their own identifier schemas instead.</p>\n<p>Why
  is that? and why does someone think they're interesting enough to talk about at
  a conference?</p>\n<p>Let's go down this rabbit whole together, today you'll learn:</p>\n
  <ul>\n<li>why there were five versions of UUIDs in the original spec</li>\n<li>which
  versions are still useful today, and when you should consider using them</li>\n
  <li>why, even so, they weren't considered fit-for-purpose for many situations</li>\n\
  <li>what's being done to fix that</li>\n<li>~~what's the difference between UUID
  and GUID?~~</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll bet you'll find the answers more interesting than
  you expected to!</p>"
