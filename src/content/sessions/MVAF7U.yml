abstract: <p>Google Crisis Response saved lives and tried to make the world better.
  And all of it was in Python.</p>
description: "<p>At one point before Google switched to suck, they let a bunch of
  us try to save the world. And mapvisage, person finder, crisismap? All in Python
  (ok there was some JavaScript and even Flash involved). Having your Python on Appengine
  site embedded on the front page of pretty much every news site on earth? Quite a
  lot to cope with.</p>\n<p>After another time I had to stop building a coffee table
  to run upstairs to task satellites. As you do on a weekend, get home from IKEA,
  start assembling and go oops need ask people to point their flying space robot cameras
  at this bit of the world. Normal weekend.</p>\n<p>And I will eventually finish my
  book.</p>"
