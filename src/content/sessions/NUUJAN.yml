abstract: "<p>You likely have a good pipeline that either runs tests, lints, or deployments
  for your project.</p>\n<p>But when it comes to changing that pipeline, how sure
  are you that it works before taking those changes live?</p>"
description: "<p>In this talk, we'll explore why it doesn't have to be the case that
  \"there's no devops for devops\".</p>\n<p>We'll give a quick run down of what pipelines
  are, and why they should be used, before we give an example where it can be hard
  to know whether making changes to a gitlab pipeline will fail, and why that can
  be the case.</p>\n<p>Then, we'll showcase tools that can be used for testing, creating,
  and simulating pipelines, so you too can setup a system to always be sure that your
  pipeline changes won't cause any water damage.</p>"
