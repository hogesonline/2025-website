abstract: "<p>Got a billion rows of data in a weird file format? Wishing you could
  wrangle a dataframe from a geospatial dataset? A bit lost interacting with a remote
  API? Let’s wrangle some data with Python and DuckDB. </p>\n<p>DuckDB executes analytical
  SQL queries without the need for a server. DuckDB features a deep and deceptively
  simple integration with the Python ecosystem, allowing us to query, wrangle, and
  output data, alongside all your favourite Python tools.. Its powerful analytical
  features and rich integrations position DuckDB as an invaluable tool for anyone
  working with analytical data in Python, helping you solve complex problems with
  ease and elegance. \nIn this practical talk, we’ll introduce DuckDB, a fast and
  versatile analytical database to keep in your data toolkit. We’ll go through how
  to use the DuckDB Python client effectively, taking advantage of DuckDB’s efficient
  data processing features, as well as its integrations with libraries like Pandas
  and Ibis.</p>"
