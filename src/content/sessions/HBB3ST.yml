abstract: <p>Make sure sensitive data is accessible only to the right people at the
  right time.</p>
description: "<p>You’ve got sensitive customer data you need to protect in your Python
  web service.</p>\n<p>You’ve done all the right things to secure it — using SQLAlchemy
  to sanitise inputs to your SQL queries, HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt, and Semgrep in
  your CD pipeline.</p>\n<p>You’ve even gone the extra mile — using cryptography and
  SQLAlchemy’s StringEncryptedType to encrypt each row of data with AES.</p>\n<p>But
  you have a lingering feeling that it’s all not quite enough. So how do you shake
  that feeling?</p>\n<p>One of the best ways to understand a system is to break it
  and rebuild it. That is what we’re going to do in this session.</p>\n<p>In this
  workshop you’ll learn:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to secure, break, and then re-secure an
  encrypted data vault built using Python and PostgreSQL</li>\n<li>The cryptography
  fundamentals you need to pay attention to, and the ones you don’t</li>\n<li>Plus:
  how quantum safety should affect how you encrypt data today</li>\n</ul>"
