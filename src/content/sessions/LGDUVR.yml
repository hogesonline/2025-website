abstract: "<p>The purpose of this presentation is to introduce the audience to the
  field of mathematical optimisation - what it is, how it differs from machine learning,
  and the types of problems it is best suited to solve.</p>\n<p>The first section
  will provide this context and background - describing the anatomy of an optimisation
  problem, and what the model building process looks like. We will touch on the characteristics
  common to optimisation problems seen across multiple industries.</p>\n<p>We will
  then build a simple optimisation model together, demonstrating how the model building
  process compares to the machine learning approach.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will end
  by exploring some of the most fascinating applications of mathematical optimisation
  in industry, focussing on the characteristics that the audience can map to challenges
  that are specific to their own industry.</p>"
description: "<p>What do you do if the problem you want to model has little or no
  clean and available historic data? Or, what if you do have historic data, but things
  have changed so much that it is no longer possible to use that data to make predictions
  about the future? On top of that, what if you want your model to incorporate hard
  constraints that it cannot violate, and these constraints can lead to extremely
  different modelled outcomes?</p>\n<p>Many data scientists would recognise that for
  these kinds of problems, most machine learning algorithms tend to struggle. However,
  it is precisely for this reason that the field of mathematical optimisation (MO)
  was developed. Despite flying relatively under the radar in the data science community,
  MO plays a critical role solving problems in multiple sectors. The airline industry
  for example, is so dependent on MO for plane and workforce scheduling, that an entire
  fleet of planes will be grounded if a bug prevents one of these models solving.</p>\n
  <p>In this presentation, we will introduce the audience to the field of mathematical
  optimisation, and the types of problems it is exceptionally good at solving. We’ll
  build a simple model together, and explore how different the approach is to developing
  a machine learning model. By the end of this talk, we hope many members of the audience
  will be able to map MO to a problem they are actively trying to solve, and they
  will be excited to explore applying this technique.</p>"
