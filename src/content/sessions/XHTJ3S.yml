abstract: "<p>In the past decade, this school has consistently exceeded VCE expectations
  in Software Development, largely due to well-developed resources, consistency in
  use of programming language (Visual Basic) and progression of skills through year
  7 to year 12. However, a gap analysis in the teaching methodology has highlighted
  conceptual computational thinking and problem-solving skills as a key gap in the
  current offering. This was attributed to the curriculum's skills-based focus and
  the Covid-era teaching practice of flipped learning via video tutorials.  </p>\n
  <p>This has presented an opportunity to overhaul the teaching methodology to focus
  on equipping students with the skills to apply their learning in different contexts.\
  \  Some key aspects of this transformation include a more live coding technique
  and transitioning to Python as the preferred programming language, due to its versatility
  and future prospects for students.  </p>\n<p>We present this roadmap which leads
  to a complete overhaul of our teaching programmes from year 7 to year 12, scaffolding
  Python across Applied Computing, STEM projects, Robotics and Game development over
  the next 6 months.</p>"
