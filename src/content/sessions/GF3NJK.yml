abstract: "<p>Software builders and operators have long looked to transport and aviation
  for lessons in engineering practices and safety. Today, we’ll turn our attention
  to the railways as we take 20 years of hindsight to look at the ‘Broady runaway’
  and what it can teach us.</p>\n<p>This talk will dive into the ATSB’s subsequent
  safety investigation, recommendations and parallels in the software world, offering
  us critical lessons in complex system design and incident management.</p>"
description: "<p>For software engineers, architects, managers and executives this
  is an opportunity for us to reflect and learn from the past so that we can build
  more resilient and easier to operate platforms in the future.</p>\n<p>Our runaway
  train is a 3 car electrical multiple unit (EMU) that, in 2003, did the full 17km
  Broadmeadows to Spencer st run in just 16 minutes, famously without a driver on
  board. The cause of the runaway and resulting collision with a stationary diesel
  locomotive has been the talk of many rail enthusiasts ever since, especially since
  there were no fatalities or serious injuries.</p>"
